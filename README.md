# Presentation about research design

This repo hosts a presentation for our 'Forschungspraktikum' at University of Graz, to be presented on 27th of January 2016.

The presentation is powered by [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), which is included as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

Content is written to `zwischenbericht.md`, which is then converted with `makefile` to `index.html`. Styling is done via `zwischenbericht.css`.
